### **“AI-Powered Agent for Automated GitHub Pull Request Review”**

The goal of this repo is to test whether the reviewer system:
- Successfully fetches PR diffs from GitHub  
- Runs all prompt strategies (Zero-shot, CoT, Few-shot, Reflection, etc.)  
- Generates review outputs without runtime errors  
- Updates model selector state correctly  
- Works end-to-end without inspecting the internal logic (true blackbox testing)
